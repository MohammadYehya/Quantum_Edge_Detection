# Quantum_Edge_Detection
Quantum Edge Detection using Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) and Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR) along with a modified Quantum Hadamard Edge Detection (QHED) Algorithm. It is also my 7th semester project for the course CS4084 Quantum Computing.
