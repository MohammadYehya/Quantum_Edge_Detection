Quantum Edge Detection using different Quantum Encoding strategies which include Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI), Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR) and Quantum Probabilty Image Encoding (QPIE) along with a modified Quantum Hadamard Edge Detection (QHED) Algorithm. It is also my 7th semester project for the course CS4084 Quantum Computing.
